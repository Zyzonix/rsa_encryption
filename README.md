# Java RSA-Encryptiontool

This simple software is able to calculate public and private key for a simple RSA Encryption.

#### Features:
* calculating RSA-keys (private and public) with numbers which are given by the user
* testing RSA key for functionality (if the keys were generated before, both keys are already stored in, the programm will only ask for a number which is then used to check the functionality)
* crack private RSA-key (therefore the public key + e is required)

#### Installation/Requirements:
* Java 14 (JDK 14)
* just download [this](https://github.com/Zyzonix/rsa_encryption/blob/main/compiled_jar/rsa_calculation.jar) then open terminal/cmd
```
java -jar rsa_encryption.jar
```
